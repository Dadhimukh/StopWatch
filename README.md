# StopWatch
This project is given by Coding Ninjas

Go live ===>   https://dadhimukh.github.io/StopWatch/

In this project the main function is stopwath() , this function is handeling the time of count(miliseconds),
I used setTimeout function,only the logic is if we want count 100 then how we manage the 1000 miliseconds,
so i did 1000/100 = 10, so i used 10 in second perameter of setTimeout function,and other are if,elseif and 
else conditions are used,like if the count is 100 then seconds will increased by 1 and reset the count,elseif 
seconds is 60 then minutes is increase by 1 and reset the seconds,elseif minute is 60 then hour is increase 
by 1 and reset the minutes and seconds at 0;
